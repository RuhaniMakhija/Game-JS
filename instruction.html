                <li>As the game progresses, obstacles will appear on the screen, moving towards the dragon.</li>
                <li>Your goal is to help the dragon leap over these obstacles.</li>
                <li>You can move the dragon by left, right and Up key of keyboard.</li>
                <li>Each successful jump over an obstacle will earn you points, increasing your score. Aim to accumulate as many points as possible.</li>
                <li>Be careful not to let the dragon collide with any obstacles. If the dragon hits an obstacle, the game will end.</li>
